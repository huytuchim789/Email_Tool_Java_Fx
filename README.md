Goal: In the enterprise, email merging is considered an integral part of business activity, as well as manipulating some of the activities of the email merging application in business activity. For example, create a partner invitation, print a list of customers attending company events, print many people's certificates with one click, email employee salary change confirmations at the end of the year, and work contracts. We aim to reduce the time required to operate payment stubs, notifications, and thank-you letters.

Description: I would like to create an email merging application to solve the problem of being able to send a large number of emails all at once, such as recruiting staff, creating invitations to partners and customers, and creating notifications.

Sticking points:
This is a desktop app that runs in JavaFX. The app can be installed on all desktop platforms such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. The user only has to fill in the Excel file to send the email. Accounts and user passwords are not stored in the database, which makes them secure.
